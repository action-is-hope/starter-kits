# Shelley + Stylable Starter Kits

Welcome! This our our little dumping ground for [Stylable](https://stylable.io/) + Shelley starter kits. Stylable is an understated CSS preprocessor , it's developed by web powerhouse Wix who have been working on some [Stylable examples](https://github.com/wixplosives/stylable-examples) which is worth checking out.

The starter includes Shelley, our UI lib built on top of Stylable.

Wix might seem like an unlikely candidate for standards based CSS but we can assure you that the team loooking after this project is all about the standards. We love it, without it Shelley would not exist üê£.


Why do we love stylable so much?

- Simple;
- Standards;
- Decouple Style from components alowing for complete reskins;
- Simple, again but can't stress this enough in comparason to CSS-in-JS;
- JS-in-CSS just makes more sense IOHO.

# Stylable + Shelley with Gatsby

Typescript starter for Gatsby including Jest setup.

In terms of getting stylable going on existing Gatsby setups you will need:

- Add the [stylable plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@stylable/webpack-plugin) to your `gatsby-node.js`
- If you are working with Typescript you will need to define a [global module declaration for the `@stylable/runtime`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@stylable/runtime#typescript-integration).

- Install VSCode extension "stylable-intelligence"
